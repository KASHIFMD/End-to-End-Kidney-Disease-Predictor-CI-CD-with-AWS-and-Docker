# End-to-End-Kidney-Disease-Predictor-CI-CD-with-AWS-and-Docker


The "Kidney Disease Prediction" project is a comprehensive endeavor that covers the entire data science and machine learning pipeline. Its goal is to develop a robust system for predicting kidney disease and to deploy it for real-world use.

The project begins with a detailed introduction, setting the stage for the complex work that follows. It involves data science, machine learning, version control, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and cloud computing.

Here's a high-level overview of the project's key components:

1. Data Ingestion and Setup: The project starts by setting up a GitHub repository, creating a project template, installing necessary requirements, and organizing essential modules for logging, exception handling, and utility functions.

2. Workflows and Data Preparation: The project workflows are laid out, and the data ingestion component is introduced. This step involves collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the dataset to make it ready for model building.

3. Model Development: A base model is prepared, and then a model trainer component is implemented. This is where the heart of the machine learning happens. The model is trained, evaluated, and integrated with MLflow for tracking.

4. Version Control: The project introduces Data Version Control (DVC) to manage data and model versioning.

5. Pipeline and Deployment: A prediction pipeline and user application are created. The project is dockerized for easy deployment. Continuous integration and deployment on AWS ensure that the kidney disease prediction model is available for use at all times.

6. Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of the work, highlighting the achievement of building a comprehensive system for kidney disease prediction, starting from data preprocessing and leading to a fully deployed application.

  In essence, this project is a deep dive into the end-to-end process of building and deploying a machine learning system for predicting kidney disease. It leverages a wide array of technologies and tools, making it an excellent learning resource for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and developers looking to understand the entire lifecycle of a data science project.
